    for faster inference you probably want to consider
    - reducing the model precision (mixed precision or simply half precision) on new GPUs with TensorCores
            but do not forget to set the cudnn benchmark https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/46377
    - compiling the model to torchscript
    - or compiling it with Pytorch 2.0 (not yet released)
    - or using TensorRT

    see benchmark.py script for how to test the influences inference speed, which is ofc determined by the model (size), the input size and your hardware.
