    """Pytorch Dataset for COCO-formatted Keypoint dataset

    cf. https://cocodataset.org/#format-data for more information. We expect each annotation to have at least the keypoints and num_keypoints fields.
    Each category should also have keypoints. For more information on the required fields and data types, have a look at the COCO parser in `coco_parser.py`.

    The dataset builds an index during the init call that maps from each image_id to a list of all keypoints of all semantic types in the dataset.

    The Dataset also expects a keypoint_channel_configuration that maps from the semantic types (the keypoints in all categories of the COCO file) to the channels
    of the keypoint detector. In the simplest case this is simply a list of all types, but for e.g. symmetric objects or equivalence mapping one could combine different
    types into one channel. For example if you have category box with keypoints [corner0, corner1, corner2, corner3] you could combine  them in a single channel for the
    detector by passing as configuration [[corner0,corner1,corner2,corner3]].

    You can also select if you want to train on annotations with flag=1 (occluded).

    The paths in the JSON should be relative to the directory in which the JSON is located.


    The __getitem__ function returns [img_path, [keypoints for each channel according to the configuration]]
